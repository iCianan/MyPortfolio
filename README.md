## This is my personal website and blog. 

I'm most familiar with the .NET stack + JQuery aka C#/VB.NET/ASP.NET/SQL Server but I wanted to 
gain some exposure to some of the newest Javascript frameworks. It's easy to get comfortable and become a dinosaur in this industry and I refuse to go the way of the woolly mammoth. I picked React + Node over Angular and Vue because it seemed to be gaining the most traction and a bit easier to get a solo project out quickly. 

I'm using Microsoft Azure to host this application and Let's Encrypt to secure the connection. I'm constantly improving the site as I learn new things. SEO compatibilty and mobile responsiveness is probably my biggest concern for now. 

Overall this site is my way of implementing and sharing the new skills I pick up along the way. It's amazing how much you learn building from scratch without help. This project has pushed me to new heights and will continue to show myself what I'm capable of.
